  ## The CRD upgrade job mitigates the limitation of helm not being able to upgrade CRDs.
  ## The job will apply the CRDs to the cluster before the operator is deployed, using helm hooks.
  ## It deploys a corresponding clusterrole, clusterrolebinding and serviceaccount to apply the CRDs.
  ## This feature is in preview, off by default and may change in the future.
